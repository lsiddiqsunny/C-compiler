# CSE-310-Compiler-Sessional
# Objectives
Basic issues, compiler structure, front end, back end; Lexical analysis:
Tokens, patterns, and lexemes, input buffering, transition diagrams,
lexical-analyzer generator; Syntax analysis: Elimination of left recursion,
left factoring, FIRST and FOLLOW, LL(1) grammars, nonrecursive
predictive parsing, parser generators; Syntax-directed translation: Syntaxdirected
definitions, inherited and synthesized attributes, dependency
graphs, syntax-directed translation schemes; Semantic analysis: Type
expressions, type equivalence, type-checking; Run-time environments:
Storage organization, static versus dynamic storage allocation, activation
trees, activation records; Intermediate code generation: Directed acyclic
graphs for expressions, three-address code, quadruples, triples, static
single-assignment form; Code generation; Code optimization: Basic blocks
and flow graphs, next-use information, optimization of basic blocks.
